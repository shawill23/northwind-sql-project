# Northwind SQL Project 

## Overview 
This project uses the **Northwind database** to practice and demonstrate SQL skills. 
I wrote queries to explore data such as customers, orders, products, and employees, focusing on **aggregations, joins, filtering, and case logic**. 

The goal of this project was to: 
- Strengthen SQL fundamentals. 
- Work with a realistic dataset. 
- Showcase problem-solving and data analysis with SQL.
