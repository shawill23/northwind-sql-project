# Northwind SQL Project 

## Overview 
This project uses the **Northwind database** to practice and demonstrate SQL skills. 
I wrote queries to explore data such as customers, orders, products, and employees, focusing on **aggregations, joins, filtering, and case logic**. 

The goal of this project was to: 
- Strengthen SQL fundamentals. 
- Work with a realistic dataset. 
- Showcase problem-solving and data analysis with SQL.

## Files in this Repository 
- **northwind queries** â†’ All SQL queries used for the project. 
- **answers** â†’ Output examples/results for the queries. 

---

##  SQL Skills Demonstrated 
- **Aggregation functions**: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()` 
- **Joins**: Inner joins 
- **Filtering**: `WHERE`, `HAVING` 
- **Grouping and sorting**: `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT` 
- **Case statements**: Conditional logic with `CASE` 
- **String functions**: `SUBSTRING()`

##  Example Questions Answered 
1. How many orders has each customer placed? Show customer names, ordered from highest to lowest.
2. Which products generate the highest sales (Top 5)?
3. What is the average unit price of products? 
4. What is the stock status of each product?
5. Which employees report to whom?
6. Which customers have placed more than five orders?
7. What are the short names (first four letters) of each customer's contact name?

##  How to Run 
1. Clone this repository. 
2. Import the **Northwind database** into MySQL. 
3. Run queries from the `northwind queries` file. 
4. Compare results with the outputs in `answers`.

## ðŸ“– Next Steps 
- Expand queries with subqueries and window functions. 
- Build a visualization layer (Power BI or Tableau) on top of Northwind data.
